 # World Music Mixer
 
  This is the repo about how we create a website with drag and drop functionality. When you drag an instrument into the specific element, it will play that instrument. You will have about 4 to 5 different intruments to drag in order to create a complete song. Our web page is a world map. When you drag an instrument, pulsing circles apper on the wold map. Those circles indicate the most popular cities at each continent.
